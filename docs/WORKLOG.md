# CLAPP Worklog

## 2026-09-23 — Greenfield handoff established

Repository state:
- `payswapdotorg/clapp` exists.
- Default branch: `main`.
- Repository was empty at handoff creation.

Architectural decisions established:
- Web is the first complete target.
- Behavioral reconstruction is the core abstraction, not literal source recovery.
- Behavioral IR is platform-neutral.
- Differential verification is a first-class subsystem from the beginning.
- Successful builds feed a verified package library.
- Package promotion is evidence- and test-gated.
- Authorization, sandboxing, secret redaction, and provenance are foundational rather than post-MVP additions.
- Three workers have explicit ownership boundaries.

Next execution action:
- Tech lead creates Phase 0 work packets from IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md.
- Worker outputs must follow WORKER_HANDOFFS.md.
- No dependent work begins against an unfrozen interface.

## 2026-09-23 — Phase 0 integrated: workspace, persistence, execution contract

Wave/phase: P0 Foundation (CLAPP-001, CLAPP-002, CLAPP-003), three parallel workers.

Integrated commits:
- f5061ab + feec678 — CLAPP-001 (W1): bun-workspace monorepo scaffold, strict
  TS 5.9, ESLint 9 flat config, CI workflow mirroring the local battery,
  packages/core (@clapp/core) implementing the run/event/artifact contract v0
  verbatim + id/hash/event helpers + hello-run seed; 34 unit tests.
- 234d29f — CLAPP-002 (W2): packages/store (@clapp/store): content-addressed
  ArtifactStore, append-only RunStore, filesystem + in-memory implementations,
  loadRun replay; 43 unit tests.
- cc5aa94 — CLAPP-003 (W3): packages/sandbox (@clapp/sandbox): isolated
  execution profiles (cwd isolation, env allowlist, duration budget with kill,
  output-size truncation, honest enforcement reporting), fixtures; 15 unit
  tests.
- 03d40a0, d43ddaf — tech-lead integration merges (root scaffolding canonical
  from CLAPP-001; packages/core/src/contract.ts byte-identical in all three
  worker trees — the declared contract held exactly).

Tests: full battery on the integrated tree AND on a fresh clean checkout:
bun install (226 packages), bun run typecheck (0 errors), bun run lint
(0 errors), bun test — 92 pass / 0 fail / 293 expect() calls across 10 files.

Acceptance status:
- CLAPP-001 A1 (fresh checkout installs and passes type/lint/unit) — PASS.
- CLAPP-002 (evidence bundle written, hashed, retrieved, replayed) — PASS.
- CLAPP-003 (fixture app runs in an isolated execution profile) — PASS.

Interface freezes (tech-lead decision, effective now):
- Run/event/artifact contract v0: packages/core/src/contract.ts — FROZEN
  (RunId/RunMeta/RunBudget/RunStatus/EvidenceKind/EvidenceRef/RunEvent/
  RunEventKind/ArtifactKind/ArtifactRecord exactly as declared; changes now
  require an ADR).
- Artifact/store contract: @clapp/store public surface (ArtifactStore,
  RunStore, PutArtifactInput, LoadedRun, Fs/Memory implementations, loadRun)
  — FROZEN; engine adapters (e.g. Postgres) must implement these interfaces.
- Execution contract: @clapp/sandbox public surface (ExecutionProfile,
  ExecutionSpec, ExecutionOutcome, ExecutionResult, SandboxExecutor,
  ProcessSandboxExecutor, NetworkPolicy with deny-all default) — FROZEN;
  the enforcement map in ExecutionResult is the honesty contract for every
  future runner.

Newly discovered risks:
- Worker delivery channel fragility: completion reports froze mid-stream on
  2/3 sessions (platform stream interruption); recovery required fresh-tab
  resync + staging directives into the sandbox project root. Worker sandboxes
  have ~2h TTL — deliveries must be harvested immediately.
- Sandbox network enforcement is contract-only in v0 (documented honest
  limitation in the package); real egress control must land with the browser
  runner wave.

ADRs added/changed: none this wave (all implementations followed the declared
contracts; the include-glob root typecheck choice is recorded in the CLAPP-001
report's disagreements section for later ADR consideration).

Next unblocked work: P1 web observation wave — CLAPP-010 (browser runner, W1,
depends on 001+003), CLAPP-011 (evidence manifest, W2, depends on 002),
CLAPP-012 (journey recording/replay, W3, depends on 003). All three
dependencies are now frozen.

## 2026-09-25 — Phase 1 integrated: web observation engine (re-dispatched wave)

Wave/phase: P1 Web Observation (CLAPP-010, CLAPP-011, CLAPP-012), three
parallel workers. (Full re-dispatch: the original 2026-09-24 P1 sessions and
their staged sandboxes were reaped server-side before delivery transit; the
wave restarted from NOT_STARTED on the frozen Phase-0 base per the
sandbox-reset doctrine — nothing was lost that had reached origin.)

Integrated commits:
- 350f9eb — base (Phase-0, frozen contracts).
- dbb45e7 — CLAPP-011 (W2): packages/evidence — RecordingSession over the
  frozen RunStore/ArtifactStore implementing the canonical EvidenceRecorder
  port; EvidenceBundle manifest + canonicalJson + rootHash; verify() with
  the fixed 11-code tamper set; saveBundle/loadBundle; 117 tests.
- bd1046e (2 commits) — CLAPP-012 (W3): packages/journey — canonical
  journey-contract.ts; validateJourney with path-qualified errors; recorder
  state machine; DOM ActionApplier on an in-package minidom/a11y shim;
  replayJourney; b01 fixture corpus (6 pages, zero external refs) + stdlib
  fixture server; 4 seeded journeys; never-skipped sandbox-execution proof;
  bonus Playwright applier (green in real chromium); 141 tests.
- 12298ba — CLAPP-010 (W1): packages/observe — ObservationRunner over a
  PageDriver port (Playwright-backed); capture channels (DOM+roles,
  screenshots, console/runtime, network req/resp/failure, WS frames,
  storage inventories, SW registrations, static inventory) through
  SessionCore (prune/redact/canonical-check/bounded batching) into the
  EvidenceRecorder port; launchServerInSandbox under the frozen
  SandboxExecutor with duration-budget reaper; 135 tests incl. real e2e.
- 5da2d68, 4686200, 7c151a1 — tech-lead integration merges (bun.lock
  regenerated at the 012 and 010 seams; conflict-free elsewhere).

Tests: station battery on the integrated tree AND on a fresh clean
checkout (identical): bun install 230 packages; bun run typecheck 0
errors; bun run lint 0 errors; bun test 485 pass / 0 fail / 1885 expect()
calls across 38 files — exact reconciliation with the three worker
reports (92+117+141+135 tests; 293+365+576+651 expects). 010's browser
e2e suites executed in this environment's cached chromium (not skipped).

Acceptance status:
- CLAPP-010 (authorized test app yields a complete observation session;
  records immutable, hashed, redacted, deterministic) — PASS.
- CLAPP-011 (evidence bundle written, hashed, retrieved, replayed;
  tamper-evident with fixed codes) — PASS.
- CLAPP-012 (journeys record → validate → replay against the b01 corpus
  inside an isolated execution profile) — PASS.

Interface freezes (tech-lead decision, effective now):
- Capture contract v0: packages/evidence/src/capture-contract.ts —
  CANONICAL (byte-identical mirror verified in @clapp/observe). Changes
  require an ADR.
- Journey contract v0: packages/journey/src/journey-contract.ts —
  CANONICAL (byte-identical mirror verified in @clapp/observe). Changes
  require an ADR.
- @clapp/evidence public surface (RecordingSession, EvidenceBundle,
  buildBundle, loadRunFromStores, verify, saveBundle, loadBundle,
  TamperCode union, TAMPER_CODES, canonicalJson/Bytes) — FROZEN
  (tamper codes are extend-only, never rename).
- @clapp/journey public surface (validateJourney, createRecorder,
  ActionApplier, replayers, fixture-server launcher) — FROZEN.
- @clapp/observe public surface (ObservationRunner, PageDriver,
  createPlaywrightDriverFactory, launchServerInSandbox, SessionCore,
  capture-contract mirror) — FROZEN.

Newly discovered risks:
- Worker-chat + workspace reaping after long idle: the platform reaped
  ALL CLAPP chats and workspaces between sessions — delivery transit
  must be harvest-on-render, and origin pushes must not wait for the
  next session.
- Transcript renderer collapses long-message middles ("Show full
  message"); report completeness must be judged after the expander
  sweep, never on a raw innerText window.
- bun.lock conflicts are structural at wave merges (each parallel
  worker regenerates it) — resolution by bun install regeneration is
  the standing procedure.

ADRs added/changed: none required. Two worker design choices recorded
for later ADR consideration: (a) @clapp/journey's own minidom shim
(zero-dep, network-deny-safe) vs a DOM-lib dependency; (b) @clapp/observe
carrying the journey-contract mirror for action-step typing (severable
surface if the lead later decouples).

Next unblocked work: P2 behavioral model wave — CLAPP-020 (Behavioral IR,
W2, depends on 011), CLAPP-021 (evidence-to-IR extraction, W2),
CLAPP-022 (exploration policy, W1, depends on 012+020); then CLAPP-013
(web observation integration gate — tech lead) once the P2 contracts are
declared.
